## Problem 1

```{r load data}

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

_Description_:
The penguins dataset contains `r nrow(penguins)` observations of penguins from the species Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. Some of the `r ncol(penguins)` variables include the  islands the penguins are from (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen), as well as different physiological measurements. For example, the flipper length was measured and the mean length was found to be `r round(mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE))` mm.

```{r scatterplot, echo = FALSE}

penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = flipper_length_mm,
             color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Bill Length (mm)") + ylab("Flipper Length (mm)") + 
  labs(color = "Species")

ggsave("hw1_penguinsscatterplot.jpeg")

```
