# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Dataset Description:

The penguins dataset contains 344 observations of penguins from the
species Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. Some of the 8 variables include
the islands the penguins are from (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen), as well as
different physiological measurements. For example, the flipper length
was measured and the mean length was found to be 201 mm.

# Problem 2

## New Data Frame Attempt

``` r
hw1_df = 
  hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  var_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")),
  )

x <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
vectorLength = length(x)
cat("Length of vector x is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector x is : 10

``` r
y <- c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")
vectorLength = length(y)
cat("Length of vector y is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector y is : 10

I created a data frame with:

-   A random sample size of 10 from a standard normal distribution with
    `rnorm`
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0 with `norm_samp_pos`
-   A character vector of length 10 with `var_char`
-   A factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels” with
    `var_factor`

## Taking the Mean of Each Variable

### Mean of norm_samp

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.09182606

### Mean of norm_samp_pos

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

### Mean of var_char

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, var_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, var_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Mean of var_factor

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, var_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, var_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

*Outcome*: I was able to take the mean of variables `norm_samp`, but not
of `var_char` or `var_factor` because they are not numeric or logical.
Surprisingly, I was also able to take the mean of `norm_samp_pos`, a
logical variable, even though it is not numeric.

## Applying as.numeric

``` r
var_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
V <- factor(var_char)
as.numeric(V)

var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary"))
as.numeric (var_factor)

norm_samp = rnorm(10)
norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0
as.numeric(norm_samp_pos)
```

*Outcome*: In order to convert the character variable into a numeric
variable via `as.numeric`, I first had to convert the character variable
into a factor variable. This is because character variables can have an
infinite number of responses whereas factor variables are nominal,
meaning the response options are predefined as a number of levels.
Factor variables have a different number of “levels”, AKA number of
responses, depending on the dataset. These levels can then correspond to
numeric outputs once the `as.numeric` function is applied. For example,
the factor variable `var_factor` has three factor levels (male, female,
nonbinary) which can correspond to the numeric values 1, 2, 3. Character
variables thus need to be given a defined set of levels before they can
be processed as numeric. This also helps explain why we were able to
take the mean of a logical but non-numeric variable, like
`norm_samp_pos`, because it is a binary variable; the only options are 0
or 1 (true or false). Thus, you can immediately take the mean of a
logical variable because they have inherent numeric value. Whereas
factor and character variables first have to be explicitly converted
into numeric values before a mean can be taken because they have more
than 2 levels.
