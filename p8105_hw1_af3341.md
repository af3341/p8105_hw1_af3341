# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Dataset Description:

The penguins dataset contains 344 observations of penguins from the
species Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. Some of the 8 variables include
the islands the penguins are from (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen), as well as
different physiological measurements. For example, the flipper length
was measured and the mean length was found to be 201 mm.

# Problem 2

## New Data Frame Attempt

``` r
hw1_df = 
  hw1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  var_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    var_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")),
  )

x <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J")
vectorLength = length(x)
cat("Length of vector x is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector x is : 10

``` r
y <- c("male", "female", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "nonbinary", "male", "male", "female", "nonbinary")
vectorLength = length(y)
cat("Length of vector y is :", vectorLength)
```

    ## Length of vector y is : 10

I created a data frame with:

-   A random sample size of 10 from a standard normal distribution with
    `rnorm`
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0 with `norm_samp_pos`
-   A character vector of length 10 with `var_char`
-   A factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels” with
    `var_factor`
